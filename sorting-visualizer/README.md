This is a little program made in pygame which allows us to see sorting algorithms in action,
I implemented some of the most famous ones. The program isn't CLI based and runs locally in the pygame window, when we launch the program
the screen will welcome us with this interface.

and by just pressing a button like explained in the instructions, a sorting algorithm is applied and
the screen will start sorting slowly so we may see the process in action.

# TODO
1. Divide the main code and the algorithms in separate files
