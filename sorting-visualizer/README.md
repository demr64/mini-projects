![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6571c459-1915-4492-a684-3e90f7303d49)This is a little program made in pygame which allows us to see sorting algorithms in action, 
I implemented some of the most famous ones. The screen will look like this when we launch the program

and by just pressing a button like explained in the instructions, a sorting algorithm is applied, which are implemented just by using functions.

The screen will start sorting and we should get a result like this in the end.

# TODO
1. Divide the main code and the algorithms in separate files
