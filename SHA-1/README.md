# SHA-1
This is a simple Python implementation of the SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) algorithm for hashing data, it is NOT considered secure anymore since 2005
It was designed by the United States National Security Agency in 1993.
SHA-1 is the successor of SHA-0, where the only difference is that there's no bitwise left rotation in the SHA-0 in the message schedule.
This implementation uses no libraries.
