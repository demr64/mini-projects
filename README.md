# mini-projects

This folder contains small projects of around 0-200 lines of code which I make for fun or for prototyping.
Some of them may not be yet finished!
Here's a comprehensive list of the projects I've done so far:

- LFractals: This subfolder contains an implementation of L-Systems which allow us to create fractal shapes. It's made with Python and the Turtle module.
- sorting-visualizer: This project is about the implementation and visualization of sorting algorithms, It's made it with Python and Pygame.
- Leonardo PCTO: In high school I did a little project about the implementation of a neural network to classify cat breeds.
